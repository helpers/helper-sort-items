## Usage

This is designed with [assemble][] collections in mind, but it's generic enough that it should work with an array of strings too.

**Example**

The following example shows how to sort and filter the items in an [assemble][] collection. 

```js
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();

app.helper('sortItems', require('{%= name %}'));
app.pages('templates/*.hbs');
```

Given that four pages have been loaded: `foo.hbs`, `bar.hbs`, `baz.hbs`, and `some-file.hbs`, the following:

```handlebars
<!-- in "some-file.hbs" -->
{{#pages}}
  {{#each (sortItems items) as |item|}}
    {{item.basename}}
  {{/each}}
{{/pages}}
```

When rendered with these options:

```js
var locals = {order: ['baz', 'bar', 'foo']};

app.render('some-file.hbs', locals, function(err, view) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(view.contents.toString());
});
```

Would result in:

```
baz.hbs
bar.hbs
foo.hbs
```

## Sort order

You can also pass the sort order as the last argument as a comma-separated string:

```handlebars
{{#pages}}
  {{#each (sortItems items "baz,foo,bar") as |item|}}
    {{item.basename}}
  {{/each}}
{{/pages}}
```

Or when used as a [handlebars][] helper, you can pass the sort order on the options hash as a comma-separated string:

```handlebars
{{#pages}}
  {{#each (sortItems items order="baz,foo,bar") as |item|}}
    {{item.basename}}
  {{/each}}
{{/pages}}
```
